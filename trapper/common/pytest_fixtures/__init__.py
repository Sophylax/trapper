"""
Utilities and helpers for writing tests. You can import the fixture modules into
the `conftest.py` file under the appropriate test directory inside your test
folder. E.g., you can import `trapper.common.pytest_fixtures.data` inside your
`tests/data/conftest.py` file assuming that `tests/data` is the package
containing the tests related to the custom data processing classes such as data
processors and collators.
